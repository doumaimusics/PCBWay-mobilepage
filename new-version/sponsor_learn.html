						<h3>Educational & Engineering PCB Program</h3>
						<div class="u-text-p">
							<p>We believe that engineers and engineering students can re-shape the world. Some of the most creative and audacious electronic research comes from our students in universities or even high schools. Therefore PCBWay.com feels proud to sponsor teachers and students for their PCB needs and help engineers to finish their non-profit projects.</p>
							<p> The biggest challenge of modern electronics is that the components are so miniaturized that students can no longer use universal boards and the parts can no longer be reliably hand soldered. By streamlining manufacturing processes, PCBWay.com is capable to fabricate your PCBs in as short as 12 hours, and offers PCB assembly under one roof as a consecutive service.</p>
							<p> Our strong network of parts suppliers makes the sourcing quick, reliable and cost-effective.</p>
