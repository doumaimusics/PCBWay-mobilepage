					</div>
					<div class="u-referral-title">
						<h5>10. When does the turn-time begin?</h5>
						<p>Due to the complexity of how to determine the turn time of PCB fabrication, our policy is that turn-time begins immediately after your Gerber files and all other necessary files being received, reviewed by us and re-approved by your side. When all these reviews and approvals are done, we will start fabrication immediately.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="u-referral-title">
						<h5>11. Are your PCBs RoHS Compliant?</h5>
						<p>Yes. But we also offer leaded PCBs.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="u-referral-title">
						<h5>12. Why do I need to panelize my boards?</h5>
						<p>Panelization is needed when your PCB dimension is smaller than 50mmx100mm, or when your PCB is of any shapes (circular, or odd shape) other than rectangle, your boards must be panelized in an array for fabrication. You can pre-panelize at your side, or we can also panelize for you. In the latter case, we will send the panelization file back to you for your approval before fabrication begins. Panelization is a MUST if your PCBs will use surface mounting machines for assembly.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="u-referral-title">
						<h5>13. Why do I need to design Break-away Rails (Break-away Tabs) ?</h5>
						<p>If the clearance between the board’s edge and copper features is less than 3.5mm (138mil), or your boards need to be panelized for some reason, Break-away rails (Break-away tabs) must be added at the two longer paralleled edges of the boards to ensure that the boards can be assembled by the SMT machine.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="u-referral-title">
						<h5>14. Can PCBWay.com change my way of shipment?</h5>
						<p>Yes, but it is based on the perception that the NEW way of shipping will be speedier for the shipping box reaching your address earlier than the previously chosen courier. All we do is to ensure your best possible ordering experiences with PCBWay.com.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="u-referral-title">
						<h5>15. What if courier company (DHL etc.,) fails to deliver my PCBs as scheduled?</h5>
						<p>This does happen from time to time, though pretty rare. If this happens, please contact courier company for updated time of delivery. Though legally we are not responsible for the delay, we still will track or phone call courier company for updates. The worst case is that we will remake PCBs for you and re-ship to you. For the extra courier charges, we may talk to courier company for compensation.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="u-referral-title">
						<h5>16. Who will be responsible for the customs duty that may be levied at my country?</h5>
						<p>As PCBWay.com fabricate your PCBs in our facilities in Shenzhen China, we ship internationally to your country. As the customs policy in different countries may differ, some customs authorities in some countries may levy customs duty on imported PCBs. If this happens, it is your responsibility to pay. In many countries, the duty may be waived or exempted.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="u-referral-title">
