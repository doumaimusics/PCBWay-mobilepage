										<p> We are proud of our quick turn time for our PCBA services. Our service ranges from 8 Hours to 48 Hours. Please choose appropriate time option to fit your schedule and budget. Due to the complexity of how to determine the turn time of PCBA services, our policy is that turn-time begins immediately after all the parts are ready and all the PCB files (Gerber files/other PCB files, etc.,) , Centroid (Pick & Place PNP file, or XY Data or files in other formats), BOM, and all other necessary data or documents/images/photos are complete for our assembly work.</p>

										<h3>Turn-key</h3>
										<p class="u-dashed">With our wide and powerful network of parts sourcing, we offer Turn-key PCBA service. We do not mark up on the parts cost. Considering the big price gap between different suppliers, we only source from reliable suppliers who may have no price advantages. We will always ask for your approval before making any decisions.</p>
										<h3>Partial Turn-key/Combo</h3>
										<p>This is our regular practice which you offer the main devices and components, while we source the rest for you. Just like the Turn-key service, we will ask for your approval on every details of the parts concerning price, quality and availability.</p>
